====CARTESIAN COORDINATE SYSTEM====

P = (x, y, [z])

y
+ 
|   + [z]
|  /
| /
|/
-------+ x

This is the standard OpenGL coordinate system where camera looks
in the -z direction from the origo.
In 2D the z axis is missing but everything else is the same.

====SPHERICAL COORDINATE SYSTEM====

P = (r, theta, phi)

r: the distance from the origo
theta: elevation (the angle of the PO vector to the XZ plane)
phi: horizontal direction (angle of PO vector to the XY plane)

-PI/2 <= theta <= +PI/2
    0 <=  phi  <  PI*2

This is an extension of the polar coordinate system into 3D
by adding a Z axis with the inclination (theta) being restricted
to +/- 90°.

====POLAR COORDINATE SYSTEM====

P = (r, theta)

r: the distance from the origo
theta: angle to the x axis
